This repository has taken inspiration from the **Yan & Zhou (2017) paper** which tested Gestalt principles using Deep CNNs. The codes and datasets used in that paper are available [here](https://github.com/zhennany/synthetic). The paper uses inception v3 networks and in this repository I have tried reproducing their results for Symmetry using inception v4 networks. I have also included further analysis for two additional Gestalt principles: Closure and Proximity.
